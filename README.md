# CSC428 SP21
Repository for CSC428, Spring 2021. Binary files, useful resources, and some lab materials are here.

## Binaries
To save some time in class, you will find compiled [binaries](https://github.com/DSUmjham/csc428sp21/tree/main/binaries) that we will use for analysis. The binary files are numbered sequentially in the order that we will likely use them and also give some indication as to what compiler options were used. For example:

 - **01_empty_O0.out** is a program that contains an empty function and was compiled without optimization (O0). Given the extension of *.out*, it was compiled using GCC.
 - **03_hello_world_x64.exe** has a simple printf to output "Hello, World" compiled as a 64-bit Windows binary. 

## Resources
The [resources](https://github.com/DSUmjham/csc428sp21/tree/main/resources) directory holds cheat sheets, guides, etc. that may come in handy while learning different tools and utilities as we cover them in class.
